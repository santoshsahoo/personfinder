This directory contains a copy of the babel/ subdirectory of the
Babel 0.9.6 release, with localedata.py replaced by a stub and the
localedata/, messages/tests/, and tests/ subdirectories omitted
(since all we use are the .po reading and writing functions).

About Babel
===========

Babel is a Python library that provides an integrated collection of
utilities that assist with internationalizing and localizing Python
applications (in particular web-based applications.)

Details can be found in the HTML files in the `doc` folder.
